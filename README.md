<p>This is a simple stock application that uses the 
Yahoo! API call and their database, the application will show
the following data to the user after they are entered a valid stock symbol:
	<ol>
		<li>Company Name</li>
		<li>The Current Stock Price<li>
		<li>The Price change and the percentage price change, also the colour of the price
		change will change depending if there was a price change or not
		for example if the price has increased then the colour will be green, but
		on the other hand if the price has dropped then the price change
		will be in red and finally if there was no price change then the
		price change will still be black </li>
		<li>Dividend</li>
		<li>Market Cap</li>
		<li>The name of the stock exchange the company is listed</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>This is the screen the user is presented with
when they first start the program.

<p>The user is presented with a onscreen keyboard, I have also disallowed
the use of the keyboard on their computer. This is because the stock 
symbol must be capitals and there can not be other special
characters in the name like !,Â£, and $ etc... But the user has a delete button
so if the user has entered the wrong character then they have the option to
remove that letter.
</p>
<p>After the user has entered their desired stock ticker they 
press the enter button that is located on the onscreen keyboard. The application
will now fetch the data for the user from the Yahoo! servers and display this
information to the user in the following form:
